Project1: Portfolio Site for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree

For this project, we were asked to build a portfolio website. We were provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and had to replicate that design in HTML and CSS. 

Requirements: Create a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects we complete through the course of your Nanodegree program. While the aim was to recreate the mockup, we were encouraged use your own custom images to personalize this project.

Once we had successfully replicated the design mockup, we were encouraged to continue tweaking and making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it our own.
