## Portfolio Site for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree (Project 1)
For this project, we were asked to build a portfolio website. We were provided a design mockup(see below) as a PDF-file, and had to replicate that design in HTML and CSS. 

### Project Requirements: 
Create a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects we complete through the course of your Nanodegree program. 
* The page at minimum includes all of the following:
* at least 4 images
* title text (h1, h2, etc.)
* regular (paragraph) text
* a logo.

### Mockup
While the aim was to recreate the mockup, once we had successfully replicated it, we were encouraged to continue tweaking the design and use our own custom images to personalize this project.
